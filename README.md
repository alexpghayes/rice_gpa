# Calculate your Rice GPA on a 4.0 scale

For unknown reasons, Rice uses A+ grades. These are going away in the near future, but in the meantime they make GPA calculations for grad school and job applications somewhat tedious.

This is a Shiny application that allows you to input your courses into a web interface and see your overall and major GPA, with the option of adjusting to a 4.0 scale.

The application is available [here](http://shinyapps.io/alexpghayes/rice_gpa)

If have R and would like to run the application locally:

```r
# install.packages(c("shiny", "tidyverse", "flexdashboard", "rhandsontable"))
# TODO: shiny::runGitHub()
```

# TODO

- instructions for running locally
- host on shiny apps, note about running out of money
- fix initialization red
- easier way to add rows in bulk?
